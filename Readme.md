# Tasteful Tweets & Tasteful Graphs
A hackathon project from `#peacehackldn`

## Tasteful Tweets
Seeking to turn hateful tweets into something a little more funny

### Example
From

to

![Altered tweet by us](./out/less-rude.png)

### How
See `-h` flag for running instructions.

Sentiment analysis is done for an account to find most hateful tweet scoring using naive Bayes classifier and a formula we devised taking into account `./dict/terrible.txt` words, using words found under `./dict/bad...` and `./dict/good...` replacement is done.

### Todo
